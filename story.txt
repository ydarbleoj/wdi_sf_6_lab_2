You want to make scrambled eggs this morning.

Do you...

~p1:c1:p2
Use Gordon Ramsey's recipe?
~p1:c2:p3
Whip up your own thing?
~p1:c3:p4
Call your friend for a recipe?

~p2
Success! The eggs are super fluffy and delicious. You are full and ready
for the day.

~p3
You are not hungry this morning, but your taste buds are crying for better.

~p4
You got tied up in a conversation with your friend arguing about the
merits of your recipe vs Gordon's. As a result you spent $15 on a lame 
breakfast at the café, because you had no time to cook.
